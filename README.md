CS-255 System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a driving school company whose intent was to create an online business in order to help better prepare driver’s to pass their driving test with the DMV. 

What did you do particularly well?
I was very detailed in my business requirements document to include all pertinent information of what DriverPass was requiring. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the Design Document and create better UML Diagrams to fully show the system design, rather than a few processes.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used my notes to interpret the user’s needs and reread the transcript multiple times to ensure I did not forget anything or leave anything out. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing a system so the newly created system will benefit the user and do what the user is wanting. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software with an open mind and effective communication. It is important to listen to what the client needs versus wanting. It is also important to understand what the client is wanting to use the system for that way it can be designed in a way that benefits the client.
